## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Start.
### Step 2: 
Get the inputs from the user for the coordinates of the first point (x_1,x_2) and the second point (y_1,y_2).
### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula formula

x_2=4
x_1=10
y_2=2
y_1=6
Distance=((x_2-x_1)**2+(y_2-y_1)**2)**0.5
print("{:.2f}".format(Distance))
